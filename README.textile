h1. IT IS OBSOLETE

Yeah it turns out rails 3.0 will provide the desired behaviour by default so there won't be any need for plugging it in. Therefor use this repo only for inspiration at most. There won't be any sense in following its development as I won't do anything here anymore. Thanks for looking though ;)


h1. What is it for

This plugin should enable your Rails 3 apps to encode the locale within the url
like: http://example.com/*en*/posts/1 without the usual quirks. Your app and
all helpers etc should behave normally.

In earlier versions of rails you had to user things like
svenfuchs/routing-filter plugin or pass :id or :locale parameters each time.

Since Rails 3 isn't released yet its entirely possible that this plugin is 
completely unnecessary and there are better ways to achieve this kind of url 
locale encoding. If you you know one - please let me know.

If you want to help out I could use help testing this plugin properly without 
the need of an entire test app.

h1. What does it do

When you install this plugin two things will happen to your Rails 3 app:

# The Localey middleware gets added to you middleware stack. It strips a locale
parameter from env['PATH_INFO'] right before it is passed to rails dispatcher
which will then see /posts instead of /en/posts. If a locale was found and valid
according to I18n.available_locales I18n.locale is set accordingly.

# ActionDispatch::Routing::RouteSet#generate is wrapped via alias_method to add
the locale to every output of the original generate method.
posts_path produces /*en*/posts instead of /posts
